            <p>
                Powerlifting is a strength sport with competitions on three lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. For each lift, the athlete has three attempts to lift maximal weight for a single repetition. Each competition is divided based on gender, age, and different weight classes. For example, the USA Powerlifting (USAPL) federation has eight weight classes in 2019: 43 kg, 47 kg, 52 kg, 57 kg, 63 kg, 72 kg, 84 kg, 84+ kg. Powerlifting federations usally change their weight classes every few years. Also, competitions can be equipped or raw. Equipped competitions allow the lifter to use certain equipment that can help boost up the total amount of weight that they can lift, such as a supportive suit, a bench shirt, and knee sleeves. In contrast, the raw competitions do not permit these types of equipment.
